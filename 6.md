#Time series decomposition {#ch6}

Time series data can exhibit a huge variety of patterns and it is
helpful to categorize some of the patterns and behaviours that can be
seen in time series. It is also sometimes useful to try to split a time
series into several components, each representing one of the underlying
categories of patterns.

In this chapter, we consider some common patterns and methods to extract
the associated components from a time series. Often this is done to help
understand the time series better, but it can also be used to improve
forecasts.

## Time series components {#sec-6-1-TSpatterns}

### Time series patterns {-}

In this chapter, we will refer to three types of time series patterns.

Trend
:   A trend exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the
    data. It does not have to be linear. Sometimes we will refer to a
    trend “changing direction” when it might go from an increasing trend
    to a decreasing trend.

Seasonal
:   A seasonal pattern exists when a series is influenced by seasonal
    factors (e.g., the quarter of the year, the month, or day of the
    week). Seasonality is always of a fixed and known period.

Cyclic
:   A cyclic pattern exists when data exhibit rises and falls that are
    *not of fixed period*. The duration of these fluctuations is usually
    of at least 2 years.

Many people confuse cyclic behaviour with seasonal behaviour, but they
are really quite different. If the fluctuations are not of fixed period
then they are cyclic; if the period is unchanging and associated with
some aspect of the calendar, then the pattern is seasonal. In general,
the average length of cycles is longer than the length of a seasonal
pattern, and the magnitude of cycles tends to be more variable than the
magnitude of seasonal patterns.

The following four examples shows different combinations of the above
components.

[!htb] !\@ref(image)(decomp1)

plot(elec,xlab=“Year”,ylab=“Australian monthly electricity production”)
plot(diff(dj),xlab=“Day”,ylab=“Daily change in Dow Jones index”)

1.  The monthly housing sales (top left) show strong seasonality within
    each year, as well as some strong cyclic behaviour with period about
    6--10 years. There is no apparent trend in the data over this period.

2.  The US treasury bill contracts (top right) show results from the
    Chicago market for 100 consecutive trading days in 1981. Here there
    is no seasonality, but an obvious downward trend. Possibly, if we
    had a much longer series, we would see that this downward trend is
    actually part of a long cycle, but when viewed over only 100 days it
    appears to be a trend.

3.  The Australian monthly electricity production (bottom left) shows a
    strong increasing trend, with strong seasonality. There is no
    evidence of any cyclic behaviour here.

4.  The daily change in the Dow Jones index (bottom right) has no trend,
    seasonality or cyclic behaviour. There are random fluctuations which
    do not appear to be very predictable, and no strong patterns that
    would help with developing a forecasting model.

### Time series decomposition  {-}{#time-series-decomposition}

We shall think of the time series $y_{t}$ as comprising three
components: a seasonal component, a trend-cycle component (containing
both trend and cycle), and a remainder component (containing anything
else in the time series). For example, if we assume an additive model,
then we can write $$y_{t} = S_{t} + T_{t} + E_{t},$$ where $y_{t}$ is
the data at period $t$, $S_{t}$ is the seasonal component at period $t$,
$T_{t}$ is the trend-cycle component at period $t$ and $E_{t}$ is the
remainder (or irregular or error) component at period $t$.
Alternatively, a multiplicative model would be written as
$$y_{t} = S_{t} \times T_{t} \times E_{t}.$$

The additive model is most appropriate if the magnitude of the seasonal
fluctuations or the variation around the trend-cycle does not vary with
the level of the time series. When the variation in the seasonal
pattern, or the variation around the trend-cycle, appears to be
proportional to the level of the time series, then a multiplicative
model is more appropriate. With economic time series, multiplicative
models are common.

An alternative to using a multiplicative model, is to first transform
the data until the variation in the series appears to be stable over
time, and then use an additive model. When a log transformation has been
used, this is equivalent to using a multiplicative decomposition because
$$y_{t} = S_{t} \times T_{t} \times E_{t} \quad\text{is equivalent to}\quad \log y_{t} = \log S_{t} + \log T_{t} + \log E_{t}.$$

Sometimes, the trend-cycle component is simply called the “trend”
component, even though it may contain cyclic behaviour as well.

[Electrical equipment manufacturing]

We will look at several methods for obtaining the components $S_{t}$,
$T_{t}$ and $E_{t}$ later in this chapter. But first, it is helpful to
see an example. We will decompose the new orders index for electrical
equipment shown in Figure \@ref(fig-6-elecequip-trend). These data show the
number of new orders for electrical equipment (computer, electronic and
optical products) in the Euro area (16 countries). The data have been
adjusted by working days and normalized so a value of 100 corresponds to
2005.

![Electrical equipment orders: the trend-cycle component (red) and raw
data (grey).](elecequip_trend)

main=“Electrical equipment manufacturing”, ylab=“New orders index”,
xlab=“”) lines(fit$time.series[,2],col="red",ylab="Trend")
\end{Rcode}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig-6-elecequip-trend} shows the trend-cycle component, $T~t~$, in red and the original data, $y~t~$, in grey. The trend-cycle shows the overall movement in the series, ignoring the seasonality and any small random fluctuations.

Figure~\ref{fig-6-elecequip-stl} shows an additive decomposition of these data. The method used for extracting components in this example is STL which is discussed in Section~\ref{sec-6-stl}.

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering\includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{elecequip_stl}
\caption{The electricial equipment orders (top) and its three additive components.}\label{fig-6-elecequip-stl}
\begin{Rcode}
plot(fit)
\end{Rcode}
\end{figure}

All three components are shown in the bottom three panels of Figure~\ref{fig-6-elecequip-stl}. These three components can be added together to reconstruct the data shown in the top panel. Notice that the seasonal component changes very slowly over time, so any two consecutive years have very similar pattern, but years far apart may have different seasonal patterns. The remainder component shown in the bottom panel is what is left over when the seasonal and trend-cycle components have been subtracted from the data. 

The grey bars to the right of each panel show the relative scales of the components. Each grey bar represents the same length but because the plots are on different scales, the bars vary in size. The large grey bar in the bottom panel shows that the variation in the remainder component is small compared to the variation in the data which has a bar about one quarter the size. In other words, if we shrunk the bottom three panels until their bars became the same size as that in the data panel, then all the panels would be on the same scale.

\begin{figure}[!htb]
\centering\includegraphics[width=.94\textwidth]{elecequip3}

\begin{Rcode}
monthplot(fit$time.series[,“seasonal”], main=“”, ylab=“Seasonal”)

It can be useful to use seasonal plots and seasonal sub-series plots of
the seasonal component. These help us to visualize the variation in the
seasonal component over time. Figure \@ref(fig-6-elecequip3) shows a seasonal
sub-series plot of the seasonal component from
Figure \@ref(fig-6-elecequip-stl). In this case, there are only very small
changes over time.

### Seasonally adjusted data {-}

If the seasonal component is removed from the original data, the
resulting values are called the “seasonally adjusted” data. For an
additive model, the seasonally adjusted data are given by $y_{t}-S_{t}$,
and for multiplicative data, the seasonally adjusted values are obtained
using $y_{t}/S_{t}$. Figure \@ref(fig-6-elecequip-sa) shows the seasonally
adjusted electrical equipment orders.

![Seasonally adjusted electrical equipment orders (red) and the original
data (grey).](elecequip_sa)

\@ref(fig-6-elecequip-sa)

plot(elecequip, col=“grey”, main=“Electrical equipment manufacturing”,
xlab=“”, ylab=“New orders index”)
lines(seasadj(fit),col=“red”,ylab=“Seasonally adjusted”)

If the variation due to seasonality is not of primary interest, the
seasonally adjusted series can be useful. For example, monthly
unemployment data are usually seasonally adjusted to highlight variation
due to the underlying state of the economy than the seasonal variation.
An increase in unemployment due to school leavers seeking work is
seasonal variation while an increase in unemployment due to large
employers laying off workers is non-seasonal. Most people who study
unemployment data are more interested in the non-seasonal variation.
Consequently, employment data (and many other economic series) are
usually seasonally adjusted.

Seasonally adjusted series contain the remainder component as well as
the trend-cycle. Therefore they are not “smooth” and “downturns” or
“upturns” can be misleading. If the purpose is to look for turning
points in the series, and interpret any changes in the series, then it
is better to use the trend-cycle component rather than the seasonally
adjusted data.

##Moving averages

The classical method of time series decomposition originated in the
1920s and was widely used until the 1950s. It still forms the basis of
later time series methods, and so it is important to understand how it
works. The first step in a classical decomposition is to use a moving
average method to estimate the trend-cycle, so we begin by discussing
moving averages.

### Moving average smoothing {-}

A moving average of order $m$ can be written as
$$\hat{T}_{t} = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{j=-k}^k y_{t+j},$$ where $m=2k+1$.
That is, the estimate of the trend-cycle at time $t$ is obtained by
averaging values of the time series within $k$ periods of $t$.
Observations that are nearby in time are also likely to be close in
value, and the average eliminates some of the randomness in the data,
leaving a smooth trend-cycle component. We call this an “$m$-MA” meaning
a moving average of order $m$.

Australia: 1989--2008.](ressales1)

For example, consider Figure \@ref(fig-6-ressales1) showing the volume of
electricity sold to residential customers in South Australia each year
from 1989 to 2008 (hot water sales have been excluded). The data are
also shown in Table \@ref(tbl-6-elecsales).

\@ref(tbl-6-elecsales)

ma(elecsales, order=5)

In the second column of this table, a moving average of order 5 is
shown, providing an estimate of the trend-cycle. The first value in this
column is the average of the first five observations (1989--1993); the
second value in the 5-MA column is the average of the values 1990--1994;
and so on. Each value in the 5-MA column is the average of the
observations in the five year period centered on the corresponding year.
There are no values for the first two years or last two years because we
don’t have two observations on either side. In the formula above, column
5-MA contains the values of $\hat{T}_{t}$ with $k=2$. To see what the
trend-cycle estimate looks like, we plot it along with the original data
in Figure \@ref(fig-6-ressales2).

![Residential electricity sales (black) along with the 5-MA estimate of
the trend-cycle (red).](ressales2)

\@ref(fig-6-ressales2)

plot(elecsales, main=“Residential electricity sales”, ylab=“GWh”,
xlab=“Year”) lines(ma(elecsales,5),col=“red”)

Notice how the trend (in red) is smoother than the original data and
captures the main movement of the time series without all the minor
fluctuations. The moving average method does not allow estimates of
$T_{t}$ where $t$ is close to the ends of the series; hence the red line
does not extend to the edges of the graph on either side. Later we will
use more sophisticated methods of trend-cycle estimation which do allow
estimates near the endpoints.

The order of the moving average determines the smoothness of the
trend-cycle estimate. In general, a larger order means a smoother curve.
Figure \@ref(fig-6-ressales3) shows the effect of changing the order of the
moving average for the residential electricity sales data.

!\@ref(image)(ressales3)

\@ref(fig-6-ressales3)

Simple moving averages such as these are usually of odd order (e.g., 3,
5, 7, etc.) This is so they are symmetric: in a moving average of order
$m=2k+1$, there are $k$ earlier observations, $k$ later observations and
the middle observation that are averaged. But if $m$ was even, it would
no longer be symmetric.

### Moving averages of moving averages {-}

It is possible to apply a moving average to a moving average. One reason
for doing this is to make an even-order moving average symmetric.

For example, we might take a moving average of order 4, and then apply
another moving average of order 2 to the results. In the following
table, this has been done for the first few years of the Australian
quarterly beer production data.

The notation “$2\times4$-MA” in the last column means a 4-MA followed by
a 2-MA. The values in the last column are obtained by taking a moving
average of order 2 of the values in the previous column. For example,
the first two values in the 4-MA column are 451.2=(443+410+420+532)/4
and 448.8=(410+420+532+433)/4. The first value in the $2\times4$-MA
column is the average of these two: 450.0=(451.2+448.8)/2.

When a 2-MA follows a moving average of even order (such as 4), it is
called a “centered moving average of order 4”. This is because the
results are now symmetric. To see that this is the case, we can write
the $2\times4$-MA as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
\hat{T}_{t} &= \frac{1}{2}\Big[\frac{1}{4} (y_{t-2}+y_{t-1}+y_{t}+y_{t+1}) + \frac{1}{4} (y_{t-1}+y_{t}+y_{t+1}+y_{t+2})\Big] \\
&= \frac{1}{8}y_{t-2}+\frac14y_{t-1}+\frac14y_{t}+\frac14y_{t+1}+\frac18y_{t+2}.\end{aligned}$$

It is now a weighted average of observations, but it is symmetric.

Other combinations of moving averages are also possible. For example a
$3\times3$-MA is often used, and consists of a moving average of order 3
followed by another moving average of order 3. In general, an even order
MA should be followed by an even order MA to make it symmetric.
Similarly, an odd order MA should be followed by an odd order MA.

### Estimating the trend {-}-cycle with seasonal data

The most common use of centered moving averages is in estimating the
trend-cycle from seasonal data. Consider the $2\times4$-MA:
$$\hat{T}_{t} = \frac{1}{8}y_{t-2}+\frac14y_{t-1}+\frac14y_{t}+\frac14y_{t+1}+\frac18y_{t+2}.$$
When applied to quarterly data, each quarter of the year is given equal
weight as the first and last terms apply to the same quarter in
consecutive years. Consequently, the seasonal variation will be averaged
out and the resulting values of $\hat{T}_t$ will have little or no
seasonal variation remaining. A similar effect would be obtained using a
$2\times 8$-MA or a $2\times 12$-MA.

In general, a $2\times m$-MA is equivalent to a weighted moving average
of order $m+1$ with all observations taking weight $1/m$ except for the
first and last terms which take weights $1/(2m)$. So if the seasonal
period is even and of order $m$, use a $2\times m$-MA to estimate the
trend-cycle. If the seasonal period is odd and of order $m$, use a
$m$-MA to estimate the trend cycle. In particular, a $2\times 12$-MA can
be used to estimate the trend-cycle of monthly data and a 7-MA can be
used to estimate the trend-cycle of daily data.

Other choices for the order of the MA will usually result in trend-cycle
estimates being contaminated by the seasonality in the data.

[Electrical equipment manufacturing] Figure \@ref(fig-6-elecequip2) shows a
$2\times12$-MA applied to the electrical equipment orders index. Notice
that the smooth line shows no seasonality; it is almost the same as the
trend-cycle shown in Figure \@ref(fig-6-elecequip-trend) which was estimated
using a much more sophisticated method than moving averages. Any other
choice for the order of the moving average (except for 24, 36, etc.)
would have resulted in a smooth line that shows some seasonal
fluctuations.

plot(elecequip, ylab=“New orders index”, col=“gray”, main=“Electrical
equipment manufacturing (Euro area)”) lines(ma(elecequip, order=12),
col=“red”)

### Weighted moving averages {-}

Combinations of moving averages result in weighted moving averages. For
example, the $2\times4$-MA discussed above is equivalent to a weighted
5-MA with weights given by
[$\frac{1}{8},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{8}$]. In
general, a weighted $m$-MA can be written as
$$\hat{T}_t = \sum_{j=-k}^k a_j y_{t+j},$$ where $k=(m-1)/2$ and the
weights are given by [$a_{-k},\dots,a_k$]. It is important that the
weights all sum to one and that they are symmetric so that
$a_j = a_{-j}$. The simple $m$-MA is a special case where all the
weights are equal to $1/m$.

A major advantage of weighted moving averages is that they yield a
smoother estimate of the trend-cycle. Instead of observations entering
and leaving the calculation at full weight, their weights are slowly
increased and then slowly decreased resulting in a smoother curve.

Some specific sets of weights are widely used. Some of these are given
in Table \@ref(tbl-6-weights).

##Classical decomposition

The classical decomposition method originated in the 1920s. It is a
relatively simple procedure and forms the basis for most other methods
of time series decomposition. There are two forms of classical
decomposition: an additive decomposition and a multiplicative
decomposition. These are described below for a time series with seasonal
period $m$ (e.g., $m=4$ for quarterly data, $m=12$ for monthly data,
$m=7$ for daily data with a weekly pattern).

In classical decomposition, we assume the seasonal component is constant
from year to year. These $m$ values are sometimes called the “seasonal
indices”.

### Additive decomposition {-}

Step 1
:   If $m$ is an even number, compute the trend-cycle component using a
    $2\times m$-MA to obtain $\hat{T}_t$. If $m$ is an odd number,
    compute the trend-cycle component using an $m$-MA to obtain
    $\hat{T}_t$.

Step 2
:   Calculate the detrended series: $y_t - \hat{T}_t$.

Step 3
:   To estimate the seasonal component for each month, simply average
    the detrended values for that month. For example, the seasonal index
    for March is the average of all the detrended March values in the
    data. These seasonal indexes are then adjusted to ensure that they
    add to zero. The seasonal component is obtained by stringing
    together all the seasonal indices for each year of data. This gives
    $\hat{S}_t$.

Step 4
:   The remainder component is calculated by subtracting the estimated
    seasonal and trend-cycle components:
    $\hat{E}_t = y_t - \hat{T}_t - \hat{S}_t$.

### Multiplicative decomposition {-}

A classical multiplicative decomposition is very similar except the
subtractions are replaced by divisions.

Step 1
:   If $m$ is an even number, compute the trend-cycle component using a
    $2\times m$-MA to obtain $\hat{T}_t$. If $m$ is an odd number,
    compute the trend-cycle component using an $m$-MA to obtain
    $\hat{T}_t$.

Step 2
:   Calculate the detrended series: $y_t/ \hat{T}_t$.

Step 3
:   To estimate the seasonal component for each month, simply average
    the detrended values for that month. For example, the seasonal index
    for March is the average of all the detrended March values in the
    data. These seasonal indexes are then adjusted to ensure that they
    add to $m$. The seasonal component is obtained by stringing together
    all the seasonal indices for each year of data. This gives
    $\hat{S}_t$.

Step 4
:   The remainder component is calculated by dividing out the estimated
    seasonal and trend-cycle components:
    $\hat{E}_t = y_t /( \hat{T}_t  \hat{S}_t)$.

### Comments on classical decomposition {-}

While classical decomposition is still widely used, it is not
recommended. There are now several much better methods. Some of the
problems with classical decomposition are summarised below.

-   The estimate of the trend is unavailable for the first few and last
    few observations. For example, if $m=12$, there is no trend estimate
    for the first six and last six observations. Consequently, there is
    also no estimate of the remainder component for the same time
    periods.

-   Classical decomposition methods assume that the seasonal component
    repeats from year to year. For many series, this is a reasonable
    assumption, but for some longer series it is not. For example,
    electricity demand patterns have changed over time as air
    conditioning has become more widespread. So in many locations, the
    seasonal usage pattern from several decades ago had maximum demand
    in winter (due to heating), while the current seasonal pattern has
    maximum demand in summer (due to air conditioning). The classical
    decomposition methods are unable to capture these seasonal changes
    over time.

-   Occasionally, the value of the time series in a small number of
    periods may be particularly unusual. For example, monthly air
    passenger traffic may be affected by an industrial dispute making
    the traffic during the dispute very different from usual. The
    classical method is not robust to these kinds of unusual values.

##X-12-ARIMA decomposition

One of the most popular methods for decomposing quarterly and monthly
data is X-12-ARIMA, which has its origins in methods developed by the US
Bureau of the Census. It is now widely used by the Bureau and government
agencies around the world. Earlier versions of the method included X-11
and X-11-ARIMA. An X-13-ARIMA method is currently under development at
the US Bureau of the Census.

The X-12-ARIMA method is based on classical decomposition, but with many
extra steps and features to overcome the drawbacks of classical
decomposition that were discussed in the previous section. In
particular, the trend estimate is available for all observations
including the end points, and the seasonal component is allowed to vary
slowly over time. It is also relatively robust to occasional unusual
observations. X-12-ARIMA handles both additive and multiplicative
decomposition, but only allows for quarterly and monthly data.

The “ARIMA” part of X-12-ARIMA refers to the use of an ARIMA model (see
Chapter \@ref(ch7)) that provides forecasts of the series forward in time, as
well as backwards in time. Then, when a moving average is applied to
obtain an estimate of the trend-cycle, there is no loss of observations
at the start and end of the series.

The algorithm begins in a similar way to classical decomposition, and
then the components are refined through several iterations. The
following outline of the method describes a multiplicative decomposition
applied to monthly data. Similar algorithms are used for additive
decompositions and quarterly data.

Compute a $2\times12$ moving average applied to the original data to
obtain a rough estimate of the trend-cycle $\hat{T}_t$ for all periods.

Calculate ratios of the data to trend (called “centered ratios”):
$y_t/\hat{T}_t$.

Apply separate $3\times3$ MAs to each month of the centered ratios to
form a rough estimate of $\hat{S}_t$.

Divide the centered ratios by $\hat{S}_t$ to get an estimate of the
remainder, $\hat{E}_t$.

Reduce extreme values of $E_t$ to get modified $\hat{E}_t$.

Multiply modified $\hat{E}_t$ by $\hat{S}_t$ to get modified centered
ratios.

Repeat Step 3 to obtain revised $\hat{S}_t$.

Divide original data by the new estimate of $\hat{S}_t$ to give the
preliminary seasonally adjusted series, $y_t/\hat{S}_t$.

The trend-cycle $\hat{T}_t$ is estimated by applying a weighted
Henderson MA to the preliminary seasonally adjusted values. (The greater
the randomness, the longer the length of the moving average used.) For
monthly series: either a 9-, 13-, or 23-term Henderson moving average is
used.

Repeat Step 2. New ratios are obtained by dividing the original data by
the new estimate of $\hat{T}_t$.

Repeat Steps 3--6 using the new ratios and applying a $3\times5$ MA
instead of a $3\times3$ MA.

Repeat Step 7 but using a $3\times5$ MA instead of a $3\times3$ MA.

Repeat Step 8.

The remainder component is obtained by dividing the seasonally adjusted
data from Step 13 by the trend-cycle obtained in Step 9.

Extreme values of the remainder component are replaced as in Step 5.

A series of modified data is obtained by multiplying the trend-cycle,
seasonal component, and adjusted remainder component together.

The whole process is repeated two more times using the data obtained in
the Step 16 each time. On the final iteration, the $3\times5$ MA of
Steps 11 and 12 is replaced by either a $3\times3$, $3\times5$, or
$3\times9$ moving average, depending on the variability in the data.

X-12-ARIMA also has some sophisticated methods to handle trading day
variation, holiday effects and the effects of known predictors, which
are not covered here.

A complete discussion of the method is available in[^1] [Ladiray and
Quenneville
(2001)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0387951717/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=prorobjhyn-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0387951717).

There is currently no R package for X-12-ARIMA decomposition. However,
free software that implements the method is available from the [US
Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/srd/www/x12a/) and an R interface
to that software is provided by the [x12
package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/x12/index.html).

##STL decomposition {#sec-6-stl}

STL is a very versatile and robust method for decomposing time series.
STL is an acronym for “Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess”,
while Loess is a method for estimating nonlinear relationships. The STL
method was developed by[^2] [Cleveland et al.
(1990)](http://cs.wellesley.edu/~cs315/Papers/stl%20statistical%20model.pdf)

STL has several advantages over the classical decomposition method and
X-12-ARIMA:

Unlike X-12-ARIMA, STL will handle any type of seasonality, not only
monthly and quarterly data.

The seasonal component is allowed to change over time, and the rate of
change can be controlled by the user.

The smoothness of the trend-cycle can also be controlled by the user.

It can be robust to outliers (i.e., the user can specify a robust
decomposition). So occasional unusual observations will not affect the
estimates of the trend-cycle and seasonal components. They will,
however, affect the remainder component.

On the other hand, STL has some disadvantages. In particular, it does
not automatically handle trading day or calendar variation, and it only
provides facilities for additive decompositions.

It is possible to obtain a multiplicative decomposition by first taking
logs of the data, and then back-transforming the components.
Decompositions some way between additive and multiplicative can be
obtained using a Box-Cox transformation of the data with $0<\lambda<1$.
A value of $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the multiplicative decomposition
while $\lambda=1$ is equivalent to an additive decomposition.

The best way to begin learning how to use STL is to see some examples
and experiment with the settings. Figure \@ref(fig-6-elecequip-stl) showed an
example of STL applied to the electrical equipment orders data.
Figure \@ref(fig-6-elecequip-stl2) shows an alternative STL decomposition
where the trend is more flexible, the seasonal component does not change
over time, and the robust option has been used. Here it is more obvious
that there has been a down-turn at the end of the series, and that the
orders in 2009 were unusually low (corresponding to some large negative
values in the remainder component).

![The electrical equipment orders (top) and its three additive
components obtained from a robust STL decomposition with flexible trend
and fixed seasonality.](elecequip_stl2)

\@ref(fig-6-elecequip-stl2)

fit \<- stl(elecequip, t.window=15, s.window=“periodic”, robust=TRUE)
plot(fit)

The two main parameters to be chosen when using STL are the trend window
(`t.window`) and seasonal window (`s.window`). These control how rapidly
the trend and seasonal components can change. Small values allow more
rapid change. Setting the seasonal window to be infinite is equivalent
to forcing the seasonal component to be periodic (i.e., identical across
years).

##Forecasting with decomposition

While decomposition is primarily useful for studying time series data,
and exploring the historical changes over time, it can also be used in
forecasting.

Assuming an additive decomposition, the decomposed time series can be
written as $$y_t = \hat{S}_t + \hat{A}_t$$ where
$\hat{A}_t = \hat{T}_t+\hat{E}_t$ is the seasonally adjusted component.
Or if a multiplicative decomposition has been used, we can write
$$y_t = \hat{S}_t\hat{A}_t,$$ where $\hat{A}_t = \hat{T}_t\hat{E}_t$.

To forecast a decomposed time series, we separately forecast the
seasonal component, $\hat{S}_t$, and the seasonally adjusted component
$\hat{A}_t$. It is usually assumed that the seasonal component is
unchanging, or changing extremely slowly, and so it is forecast by
simply taking the last year of the estimated component. In other words,
a seasonal naïve method is used for the seasonal component.

To forecast the seasonally adjusted component, any non-seasonal
forecasting method may be used. For example, a random walk with drift
model, or Holt’s method (discussed in the next chapter), or a
non-seasonal ARIMA model (discussed in Chapter \@ref(ch8)), may be used.

fcast \<- forecast(fit, method=“naive”) plot(fcast, ylab=“New orders
index”)

Figure \@ref(fig-6-elecequip4) shows naïve forecasts of the seasonally
adjusted electrical equipment orders data. These are then
“reseasonalized” by adding in the seasonal naïve forecasts of the
seasonal component. The resulting forecasts of the original data are
shown in Figure \@ref(fig-6-elecequip5). The prediction intervals shown in
this graph are constructed in the same way as the point forecasts. That
is, the upper and lower limits of the prediction intervals on the
seasonally adjusted data are “reseasonalized” by adding in the forecasts
of the seasonal component. In this calculation, the uncertainty in the
forecasts of the seasonal component has been ignored. The rationale for
this choice is that the uncertainty in the seasonal component is much
smaller than that for the seasonally adjusted data, and so it is a
reasonable approximation to ignore it.

Show that a $3\times5$ MA is equivalent to a 7-term weighted moving
average with weights of 0.067, 0.133, 0.200, 0.200, 0.200, 0.133, and
0.067.

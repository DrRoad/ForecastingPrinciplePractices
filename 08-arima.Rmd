#ARIMA models {#ch-arima}

ARIMA models provide another approach to time series forecasting. Exponential smoothing and ARIMA models are the two most widely-used approaches to time series forecasting, and provide complementary approaches to the problem. While exponential smoothing models were based on a description of trend and seasonality in the data, ARIMA models aim to describe the autocorrelations in the data.

Before we introduce ARIMA models, we need to first discuss the concept of stationarity and the technique of differencing time series.

##Stationarity and differencing

**A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed.**^[More precisely, if $\{y_t\}$ is a *stationary* time series, then for all $s$, the distribution of $(y_t,\dots,y_{t+s})$ does not depend on $t$.] So time series with trends, or with seasonality, are not stationary --- the trend and seasonality will affect the value of the time series at different times. On the other hand, a white noise series is stationary --- it does not matter when you observe it, it should look much the same at any period of time.

Some cases can be confusing --- a time series with cyclic behaviour (but with no trend or seasonality) is stationary. That is because the cycles are not of fixed length. So before we observe the series we cannot be sure where the peaks and troughs of the cycles will be.

In general, a stationary time series will have no predictable patterns in the long-term. Time plots will show the series to be roughly horizontal (although some cyclic behaviour is possible) with constant variance.

```{r stationary, fig.cap="Which of these series are stationary? (a) Dow Jones index on 292 consecutive days; (b) Daily change in Dow Jones index on 292 consecutive days; (c) Annual number of strikes in the US; (d) Monthly sales of new one-family houses sold in the US; (e) Annual price of a dozen eggs in the US (constant dollars); (f) Monthly total of pigs slaughtered in Victoria, Australia; (g) Annual total of lynx trapped in the McKenzie River district of north-west Canada; (h) Monthly Australian beer production; (i) Monthly Australian electricity production.", echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
pl <-list()
pl[[1]] <- autoplot(dj, main = "(a)", xlab = "Day")
pl[[2]] <- autoplot(diff(dj), main = "(b)", xlab = "Day")
pl[[3]] <- autoplot(strikes, main = "(c)", xlab = "Year")
pl[[4]] <- autoplot(hsales, main = "(d)", xlab = "Year")
pl[[5]] <- autoplot(eggs, main = "(e)", xlab = "Year")
pl[[6]] <- autoplot(pigs, main = "(f)", xlab = "Year")
pl[[7]] <- autoplot(lynx, main = "(g)", xlab = "Year")
pl[[8]] <- autoplot(beer, main = "(h)", xlab = "Year")
pl[[9]] <- autoplot(elec, main = "(i)", xlab = "Year")
gridExtra::marrangeGrob(pl, nrow=3, ncol=3, top="")
```

Consider the nine series plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:stationary). Which of these do you think are stationary?

Obvious seasonality rules out series (d), (h) and (i). Trend rules out series (a), (c), (e), (f) and (i). Increasing variance also rules out (i). That leaves only (b) and (g) as stationary series.

At first glance, the strong cycles in series (g) might appear to make it non-stationary. But these cycles are aperiodic --- they are caused when the lynx population becomes too large for the available feed, so they stop breeding and the population falls to very low numbers, then the regeneration of their food sources allows the population to grow again, and so on. In the long-term, the timing of these cycles is not predictable. Hence the series is stationary.

### Differencing  {-}

In Figure \@ref(fig:stationary), notice how the Dow Jones index data was non-stationary in panel (a), but the daily changes were stationary in panel (b). This shows one way to make a time series stationary --- compute the differences between consecutive observations. This is known as **differencing**.

Transformations such as logarithms can help to stabilize the variance of a time series. Differencing can help stabilize the mean of a time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, and so eliminating (or reducing) trend and seasonality.

As well as looking at the time plot of the data, the ACF plot is also useful for identifying non-stationary time series. For a stationary time series, the ACF will drop to zero relatively quickly, while the ACF of non-stationary data decreases slowly. Also, for non-stationary data, the value of $r_1$ is often large and positive.

```{r acfstationary, fig.cap="The ACF of the Dow-Jones index (left) and of the daily changes in the Dow-Jones index (right).", echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, cache=FALSE}
p1 <- ggAcf(dj)
p2 <- ggAcf(diff(dj))
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2, nrow=1)
```

The ACF of the differenced Dow-Jones index looks just like that from a white noise series. There is only one autocorrelation lying just outside the 95% limits, and the Ljung-Box $Q^*$ statistic has a p-value of 0.153 (for $h=10$). This suggests that the *daily change* in the Dow-Jones index is essentially a random amount uncorrelated with previous days.

### Random walk model  {-}

The differenced series is the *change* between consecutive observations in the original series, and can be written as
$$
  y'_t = y_t - y_{t-1}.
$$
The differenced series will have only $T-1$ values since it is not possible to calculate a difference $y_1'$ for the first observation.

When the differenced series is white noise, the model for the original series can be written as
$$
  y_t - y_{t-1} = e_t \quad\text{or}\quad {y_t = y_{t-1} + e_t}\: .
$$
A random walk model is very widely used for non-stationary data, particularly finance and economic data. Random walks typically have:

- long periods of apparent trends up or down
- sudden and unpredictable changes in direction.

The forecasts from a random walk model are equal to the last observation, as future movements are unpredictable, and are equally likely to be up or down. Thus, the random walk model underpins naïve forecasts.

A closely related model allows the differences to have a non-zero mean. Then
$$
  y_t - y_{t-1} = c + e_t\quad\text{or}\quad {y_t = c + y_{t-1} + e_t}\: .
$$
The value of $c$ is the average of the changes between consecutive observations. If $c$ is positive, then the average change is an increase in the value of $y_t$. Thus $y_t$ will tend to drift upwards. But if $c$ is negative, $y_t$ will tend to drift downwards.

This is the model behind the drift method discussed in Section \@ref(sec-2-methods).

### Second-order differencing {-}

Occasionally the differenced data will not appear stationary and it may be necessary to difference the data a second time to obtain a stationary series:
\begin{align*}
  y''_{t}  &=  y'_{t}  - y'_{t - 1} \\
           &= (y_t - y_{t-1}) - (y_{t-1}-y_{t-2})\\
           &= y_t - 2y_{t-1} +y_{t-2}.
\end{align*}
In this case, $y_t''$ will have $T-2$ values. Then we would model the "change in the changes" of the original data. In practice, it is almost never necessary to go beyond second-order differences.

### Seasonal differencing  {-}

A seasonal difference is the difference between an observation and the corresponding observation from the previous year. So
$$
  y’_t = y_t - y_{t-m}
$$
These are also called "lag-$m$ differences" as we subtract the observation after a lag of $m$ periods.

If seasonally differenced data appear to be white noise, then an appropriate model for the original data is
$$
  y_t = y_{t-m}+e_t.
$$
Forecasts from this model are equal to the last observation from the relevant season. That is, this model gives seasonal naïve forecasts.

```{r a10diff, fig.cap="Logs and seasonal differences of the A10 (antidiabetic) sales data. The logarithms stabilize the variance, while the seasonal differences remove the seasonality and trend.", fig.height=6, cache=FALSE}
tmp <- cbind(
  "Sales ($million)" = a10,
  "Monthly log sales" = log(a10),
  "Annual change in log sales" = diff(log(a10),12))
autoplot(tmp, facets=TRUE) +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Antidiabetic drug sales")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:a10diff) shows the seasonal differences of the logarithm of the monthly scripts for A10 (antidiabetic) drugs sold in Australia. The transformation and differencing has made the series look relatively stationary.

To distinguish seasonal differences from ordinary differences, we sometimes refer to ordinary differences as "first differences" meaning differences at lag 1.

Sometimes it is necessary to do both a seasonal difference and a first difference to obtain stationary data, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:diffusnetelec). Here, the data are first transformed using logarithms (second panel). Then seasonal differenced are calculated (third panel). The data still seem a little non-stationary, and so a further lot of first differences are computed (bottom panel).

```{r usmelec, fig.height=6, cache=FALSE}
tmp <- cbind(
  "Billion kWh" = usmelec,
  "Logs" = log(usmelec),
  "Seasonally\n differenced logs" = diff(log(usmelec),12),
  "Doubly\n differenced logs" = diff(diff(log(usmelec),12),1))
autoplot(tmp, facets=TRUE) +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Monthly US net electricity generation")
```

There is a degree of subjectivity in selecting which differences to apply. The seasonally differenced data in Figure \@ref(fig:a10diff) do not show substantially different behaviour from the seasonally differenced data in Figure \@ref(fig:usmelec). In the latter case, we may have decided to stop with the seasonally differenced data, and have not done an extra round of differencing. In the former case, we have decided the data were not sufficiently stationary and taken an extra round of differencing. Some formal tests for differencing will be discussed later, but there are always some choices to be made in the modeling process, and different analysts may make different choices.

If $y'_t = y_t - y_{t-m}$ denotes a seasonally differenced series, then the twice-differenced series is

\begin{align*}
y''_t &= y'_t - y'_{t-1} \\
      &= (y_t - y_{t-m}) - (y_{t-1} - y_{t-m-1}) \\
      &= y_t -y_{t-1} - y_{t-m} + y_{t-m-1}\:
\end{align*}

When both seasonal and first differences are applied, it makes no difference which is done first---the result will be the same. However, if the data have a strong seasonal pattern, we recommend that seasonal differencing be done first because sometimes the resulting series will be stationary and there will be no need for a further first difference. If first differencing is done first, there will still be seasonality present.

It is important that if differencing is used, the differences are interpretable. First differences are the change between **one observation and the next**. Seasonal differences are the change between **one year to the next**. Other lags are unlikely to make much interpretable sense and should be avoided.

### Unit root tests  {-}

One way to determine more objectively if differencing is required is to use a *unit root test*. These are statistical hypothesis tests of stationarity that are designed for determining whether differencing is required.

A number of unit root tests are available, and they are based on different assumptions and may lead to conflicting answers.

#### ADF test {-}

One of the most popular tests is the *Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test*. For this test, the following regression model is estimated:
$$
  y'_t = \phi y_{t-1} + \beta_1 y'_{t-1} + \beta_2 y'_{t-2} + \cdots + \beta_k y'_{t-k},
$$
where $y'_t$ denotes the first-differenced series, $y'_t=y_t-y_{t-1}$ and $k$ is the number of lags to include in the regression (often set to be about 3). If the original series, $y_t$, needs differencing, then the coefficient $\hat\phi$ should be approximately zero. If $y_t$ is already stationary, then $\hat{\phi}<0$. The usual hypothesis tests for regression coefficients do not work when the data are non-stationary, but the test can be carried out using the following R command.

```r
adf.test(x, alternative = "stationary")
```

In R, the default value of $k$ is set to $\lfloor(T - 1)^{1/3}\rfloor$ where $T$ is the length of the time series and $\lfloor x\rfloor$ means the largest integer not greater than $x$.

The null-hypothesis for an ADF test is that the data are non-stationary. So large p-values are indicative of non-stationarity, and small p-values suggest stationarity. Using the usual 5% threshold, differencing is required if the p-value is greater than 0.05.

#### KPSS test {-}

Another popular unit root test is the *Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test*. This reverses the hypotheses, so the null-hypothesis is that the data are stationary. In this case, small p-values (e.g., less than 0.05) suggest that differencing is required.

```r
kpss.test(x)
```

A useful R function is `ndiffs()` which uses these tests to determine the appropriate number of first differences required for a non-seasonal time series.

More complicated tests are required for seasonal differencing and are beyond the scope of this book. A useful R function for determining whether seasonal differencing is required is `nsdiffs()` which uses seasonal unit root tests to determine the appropriate number of seasonal differences required.

The following code can be used to find how to make a seasonal series stationary. The resulting series stored as `xstar` has been differenced appropriately.

```r
ns <- nsdiffs(x)
if(ns > 0)
  xstar <- diff(x,lag=frequency(x), differences=ns)
else
  xstar <- x
nd <- ndiffs(xstar)
if(nd > 0)
  xstar <- diff(xstar, differences=nd)
```

##Backshift notation

The backward shift operator $B$ is a useful notational device when working with time series lags:
$$
  B y_{t} = y_{t - 1} \: .
$$
(Some references use $L$ for "lag" instead of $B$ for "backshift".) In other words, $B$, operating on $y_{t}$, has the effect of **shifting the data back one period**. Two applications of $B$ to $y_{t}$ **shifts the data back two periods**:
$$
  B(By_{t}) = B^{2}y_{t} = y_{t-2}\: .
$$
For monthly data, if we wish to consider "the same month last year," the notation is $B^{12}y_{t}$ = $y_{t-12}$.

The backward shift operator is convenient for describing the process of *differencing*. A first difference can be written as
$$
  y'_{t} = y_{t} - y_{t-1} = y_t - By_{t} = (1 - B)y_{t}\: .
$$
Note that a first difference is represented by $(1 - B)$. Similarly, if second-order differences have to be computed, then:
$$
  y''_{t} = y_{t} - 2y_{t - 1} + y_{t - 2} = (1-2B+B^2)y_t = (1 - B)^{2} y_{t}\: .
$$
In general, a $d$th-order difference can be written as
$$
  (1 - B)^{d} y_{t}.
$$

Backshift notation is very useful when combining differences as the operator can be treated using ordinary algebraic rules. In particular, terms involving $B$ can be multiplied together.

For example, a seasonal difference followed by a first difference can be written as
\begin{align*}
(1-B)(1-B^m)y_t &= (1 - B - B^m + B^{m+1})y_t \\
&= y_t-y_{t-1}-y_{t-m}+y_{t-m-1},
\end{align*}
the same result we obtained earlier.

##Autoregressive models

In a multiple regression model, we forecast the variable of interest using a linear combination of predictors. In an autoregression model, we forecast the variable of interest using a linear combination of *past values of the variable*. The term *auto*regression indicates that it is a regression of the variable against itself.

Thus an autoregressive model of order $p$ can be written as
$$
  y_{t} = c + \phi_{1}y_{t-1} + \phi_{2}y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_{p}y_{t-p} + e_{t},
$$
where $e_t$ is white noise. This is like a multiple regression but with *lagged values* of $y_t$ as predictors. We refer to this as an **AR($p$) model**.

Autoregressive models are remarkably flexible at handling a wide range of different time series patterns. The two series in Figure \@ref(fig:arp) show series from an AR(1) model and an AR(2) model. Changing the parameters $\phi_1,\dots,\phi_p$ results in different time series patterns. The variance of the error term $e_t$ will only change the scale of the series, not the patterns.

```{r arp, fig.cap="Two examples of data from autoregressive models with different parameters. Left: AR(1) with $y_t = 18 -0.8y_{t-1} + e_t$. Right: AR(2) with $y_t = 8 + 1.3y_{t-1}-0.7y_{t-2}+e_t$. In both cases, $e_t$ is normally distributed white noise with mean zero and variance one.", echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, cache=FALSE}
set.seed(1)
p1 <- autoplot(10 + arima.sim(list(ar = -0.8), n = 100)) +
  ylab("") + ggtitle("AR(1)")
p2 <- autoplot(20 + arima.sim(list(ar = c(1.3, -0.7)), n = 100)) +
  ylab("") + ggtitle("AR(2)")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
```

For an AR(1) model:

-   when $\phi_1=0$, $y_t$ is
-   when $\phi_1=1$ and $c=0$, $y_t$ is
-   when $\phi_1=1$ and $c\ne0$, $y_t$ is
-   when $\phi_1<0$, $y_t$ tends to

We normally restrict autoregressive models to stationary data, and then some constraints on the values of the parameters are required.

-   For an AR(1) model:   $-1 < \phi_1 < 1$.
-   For an AR(2) model:   $-1 < \phi_2 < 1$,   $\phi_1+\phi_2 < 1$,

When $p\ge3$ the restrictions are much more complicated. R takes care of these restrictions when estimating a model.

##Moving average models {#sec:mamodels}

```{r maq, fig.cap="Two examples of data from moving average models with different parameters. Left: MA(1) with $y_t = 20 + e_t + 0.8e_{t-1}$. Right: MA(2) with $y_t = e_t- e_{t-1}+0.8e_{t-2}$. In both cases, $e_t$ is normally distributed white noise with mean zero and variance one.", echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, cache=FALSE}
set.seed(2)
p1 <- autoplot(20 + arima.sim(list(ma = 0.8), n = 100)) +
  ylab("") + ggtitle("MA(1)")
p2 <- autoplot(arima.sim(list(ma = c(-1, +0.8)), n = 100)) +
  ylab("") + ggtitle("MA(2)")
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2,nrow=1)
```

Rather than use past values of the forecast variable in a regression, a moving average model uses past forecast errors in a regression-like model.
$$
  y_{t} = c + e_t + \theta_{1}e_{t-1} + \theta_{2}e_{t-2} + \dots + \theta_{q}e_{t-q},
$$
where $e_t$ is white noise. We refer to this as an **MA($q$) model**. Of course, we do not *observe* the values of $e_t$, so it is not really regression in the usual sense.

Notice that each value of $y_t$ can be thought of as a weighted moving average of the past few forecast errors. However, moving average *models* should not be confused with moving average *smoothing* we discussed in Chapter \@ref(ch-decomposition). A moving average model is used for forecasting future values while moving average smoothing is used for estimating the trend-cycle of past values.

Figure \@ref(fig:maq) shows some data from an MA(1) model and an MA(2) model. Changing the parameters $\theta_1,\dots,\theta_q$ results in different time series patterns. As with autoregressive models, the variance of the error term $e_t$ will only change the scale of the series, not the patterns.

It is possible to write any stationary AR($p$) model as an MA($\infty$) model. For example, using repeated substitution, we can demonstrate this for an AR(1) model:
\begin{align*}
y_t &= \phi_1y_{t-1} + e_t\\
&= \phi_1(\phi_1y_{t-2} + e_{t-1}) + e_t\\
&= \phi_1^2y_{t-2} + \phi_1 e_{t-1} + e_t\\
&= \phi_1^3y_{t-3} + \phi_1^2e_{t-2} + \phi_1 e_{t-1} + e_t\\
&\text{etc.}
\end{align*}

Provided $-1 < \phi_1 < 1$, the value of $\phi_1^k$ will get smaller as $k$ gets larger. So eventually we obtain
$$
  y_t = e_t + \phi_1 e_{t-1} + \phi_1^2 e_{t-2} + \phi_1^3 e_{t-3} + \cdots,
$$
an MA($\infty$) process.

The reverse result holds if we impose some constraints on the MA parameters. Then the MA model is called "invertible". That is, that we can write any invertible MA($q$) process as an AR($\infty$) process.

Invertible models are not simply to enable us to convert from MA models to AR models. They also have some mathematical properties that make them easier to use in practice.

The invertibility constraints are similar to the stationarity constraints.

-   For an MA(1) model:   $-1<\theta_1<1$.
-   For an MA(2) model:   $-1<\theta_2<1$,   $\theta_2+\theta_1 >-1$, $\theta_1 -\theta_2 < 1$.

More complicated conditions hold for $q\ge3$. Again, R will take care of these constraints when estimating the models.

##Non-seasonal ARIMA models

If we combine differencing with autoregression and a moving average model, we obtain a non-seasonal ARIMA model. ARIMA is an acronym for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average model ("integration" in this context is the reverse of differencing). The full model can be written as
\begin{equation}
  y'_{t} = c + \phi_{1}y'_{t-1} + \cdots + \phi_{p}y'_{t-p}
     + \theta_{1}e_{t-1} + \cdots + \theta_{q}e_{t-q} + e_{t},  (\#eq:8-arima)
\end{equation}
where $y'_{t}$ is the differenced series (it may have been differenced more than once). The "predictors" on the right hand side include both lagged values of $y_t$ and lagged errors. We call this an **ARIMA($p, d, q$) model**, where

|      |                                       |
|-----:|:--------------------------------------|
| $p =$|order of the autoregressive part;      |
| $d =$|degree of first differencing involved; |
| $q =$|order of the moving average part.      |

The same stationarity and invertibility conditions that are used for autoregressive and moving average models apply to this ARIMA model.

Many of the models we have already discussed are special cases of the ARIMA model as shown in the following table.

|                        |                               |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------------|
| White noise            | ARIMA(0,0,0)                  |
| Random walk            | ARIMA(0,1,0) with no constant |
| Random walk with drift | ARIMA(0,1,0) with a constant  |
| Autoregression         | ARIMA($p$,0,0)                |
| Moving average         | ARIMA(0,0,$q$)                |

Once we start combining components in this way to form more complicated models, it is much easier to work with the backshift notation. Then equation \@ref(eq:8-arima) can be written as
\begin{equation}
(\#eq:arimaB)
  \begin{array}{c c c c}
    (1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p) & (1-B)^d y_{t} &= &c + (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t\\
    {\uparrow} & {\uparrow} & &{\uparrow}\\
    \text{AR($p$)} & \text{$d$ differences} & & \text{MA($q$)}\\
  \end{array}
\end{equation}

R uses a slightly different parameterization:
\begin{equation}
(\#eq:R-arima)
  (1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(y_t' - \mu) = (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t,
\end{equation}
where $y_t' = (1-B)^d y_t$ and $\mu$ is the mean of $y_t'$. To convert to the form given by \@ref(eq:arimaB), set $c = \mu(1-\phi_1 - \cdots - \phi_p )$.

Selecting appropriate values for $p$, $d$ and $q$ can be difficult. The `auto.arima()` function in R will do it for you automatically. Later in this chapter, we will learn how the function works, and some methods for choosing these values yourself.

### US consumption expenditure {-}

```{r usconsumption, fig.cap="Quarterly percentage change in US consumption expenditure.", cache=FALSE}
autoplot(usconsumption[,1]) +
  xlab("Year") + ylab("Quarterly percentage change")
```

Figure \@ref(fig:usconsumption) shows quarterly percentage changes in US consumption expenditure. Although it is quarterly data, there appears to be no seasonal pattern, so we will fit a non-seasonal ARIMA model.

The following R code was used to automatically select a model. (We use the argument `seasonal=FALSE` for now, but we will consider seasonal ARIMA models in Section \@ref(sec-seasonal-arima) )

```{r usconsumptionauto, cache=FALSE}
(fit <- auto.arima(usconsumption[,1], seasonal=FALSE))
```
```{r usconsumptioncoefs, cache=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
coef <- coefficients(fit)
intercept <- coef['intercept'] * (1-coef['ar1'] - coef['ar2'])
```

This is an ARIMA(2,0,2) model:
$$
  y_t = c + `r format(coef['ar1'], nsmall=3, digits=3)`y_{t-1}
          `r format(coef['ar2'], nsmall=3, digits=3)` y_{t-2}
          `r format(coef['ma1'], nsmall=3, digits=3)` e_{t-1}
          + `r format(coef['ma2'], nsmall=3, digits=3)` e_{t-2}
          + e_{t},
$$
where $c= `r format(coef['intercept'], nsmall=3, digits=3)` \times (1 - `r format(coef['ar1'], nsmall=3, digits=3)` + `r format(-coef['ar2'], nsmall=3, digits=3)`) = `r format(intercept, nsmall=3, digits=3)`$
and $e_t$ is white noise with standard deviation $`r format(sqrt(fit$sigma2), nsmall=3, digits=3)` = \sqrt{`r format(fit$sigma2, nsmall=3, digits=3)`}$. Forecasts from the model are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:usconsumptionf).

```{r usconsumptionf, fig.cap="Forecasts of quarterly percentage change in US consumption expenditure.", cache=FALSE}
autoplot(forecast(fit,h=10),include=80)
```

###Understanding ARIMA models  {-}

The `auto.arima()` function is very useful, but anything automated can be a little dangerous, and it is worth understanding something of the behaviour of the models even when you rely on an automatic procedure to choose the model for you.

The constant $c$ has an important effect on the long-term forecasts obtained from these models.

-   If $c=0$ and $d=0$, the long-term forecasts will go to zero.
-   If $c=0$ and $d=1$, the long-term forecasts will go to a non-zero constant.
-   If $c=0$ and $d=2$, the long-term forecasts will follow a straight line.
-   If $c\ne0$ and $d=0$, the long-term forecasts will go to the mean of the data.
-   If $c\ne0$ and $d=1$, the long-term forecasts will follow a straight line.
-   If $c\ne0$ and $d=2$, the long-term forecasts will follow a quadratic trend.

The value of $d$ also has an effect on the prediction intervals --- the higher the value of $d$, the more rapidly the prediction intervals increase in size. For $d=0$, the long-term forecast standard deviation will go to the standard deviation of the historical data, so the prediction intervals will all be essentially the same.

This behaviour is seen in Figure \@ref(fig:usconsumptionf) where $d=0$ and $c\ne 0$. In this figure, the prediction intervals are almost the same for the last few forecast horizons, and the point forecasts are equal to the mean of the data.

The value of $p$ is important if the data show cycles. To obtain cyclic forecasts, it is necessary to have $p\ge2$ along with some additional conditions on the parameters. For an AR(2) model, cyclic behaviour occurs if $\phi_1^2+4\phi_2<0$. In that case, the average period of the cycles is ^[arc cos is the inverse cosine function. You should be able to find it on your calculator. It may be labelled acos or cos$^{-1}$.]
$$
  \frac{2\pi}{\text{arc cos}(-\phi_1(1-\phi_2)/(4\phi_2))}.
$$

### ACF and PACF plots  {-}

It is usually not possible to tell, simply from a time plot, what values of $p$ and $q$ are appropriate for the data. However, it is sometimes possible to use the ACF plot, and the closely related PACF plot, to determine appropriate values for $p$ and $q$.

Recall that an ACF plot shows the autocorrelations which measure the relationship between $y_t$ and $y_{t-k}$ for different values of $k$. Now if $y_t$ and $y_{t-1}$ are correlated, then $y_{t-1}$ and $y_{t-2}$ must also be correlated. But then $y_t$ and $y_{t-2}$ might be correlated, simply because they are both connected to $y_{t-1}$, rather than because of any new information contained in $y_{t-2}$ that could be used in forecasting $y_t$.

To overcome this problem, we can use **partial autocorrelations**. These measure the relationship between $y_{t}$ and $y_{t-k}$ after removing the effects of lags $1, 2, 3, \dots, k - 1$. So the first partial autocorrelation is identical to the first autocorrelation, because there is nothing between them to remove. Each partial autocorrelation can be estimated as the last coefficient in an autoregressive model. Specifically, $\alpha_k$, the $k$th partial autocorrelation coefficient, is equal to the estimate of $\phi_k$ in an AR($k$) model. In practice, there are more efficient algorithms for computing $\alpha_k$ than fitting all these autoregressions, but they give the same results.

Figures \@ref(fig:usconsumptionacf) and \@ref(fig:usconsumptionpacf) shows the ACF and PACF plots for the US consumption data shown in Figure \@ref(fig:usconsumption). The partial autocorrelations have the same critical values of $\pm 1.96/\sqrt{T}$ as for ordinary autocorrelations, and these are typically shown on the plot as in Figure \@ref(fig:usconsumptionacf).

```{r usconsumptionacf, fig.cap="ACF of quarterly percentage change in US consumption. A convenient way to produce a time plot, ACF plot and PACF plot in one command is to use the `ggtsdisplay` function in R.", fig.height=3, cache=FALSE}
ggAcf(usconsumption[,1],main="")
```

```{r usconsumptionpacf, fig.cap="PACF of quarterly percentage change in US consumption.", fig.height=3, cache=FALSE}
ggPacf(usconsumption[,1],main="")
```

If the data are from an ARIMA($p$,$d$,0) or ARIMA(0,$d$,$q$) model, then the ACF and PACF plots can be helpful in determining the value of $p$ or $q$. If both $p$ and $q$ are positive, then the plots do not help in finding suitable values of $p$ and $q$.

The data may follow an ARIMA($p$,$d$,0) model if the ACF and PACF plots of the differenced data show the following patterns:

-   the ACF is exponentially decaying or sinusoidal;
-   there is a significant spike at lag $p$ in PACF, but none beyond lag $p$.

The data may follow an ARIMA(0,$d$,$q$) model if the ACF and PACF plots of the differenced data show the following patterns:

-   the PACF is exponentially decaying or sinusoidal;
-   there is a significant spike at lag $q$ in ACF, but none beyond lag $q$.

In Figure \@ref(fig:usconsumptionacf), we see that there are three spikes in the ACF, followed by an almost significant spike at lag 4. In the PACF, there are three significant spikes, and then no significant spikes thereafter (apart from one just outside the bounds at lag 22). We can ignore one significant spike in each plot if it is just outside the limits, and not in the first few lags. After all, the probability of a spike being significant by chance is about one in twenty, and we are plotting 22 spikes in each plot. The pattern in the first three spikes is what we would expect from an ARIMA(3,0,0) as the PACF tends to decrease. So in this case, the ACF and PACF lead us to think an ARIMA(3,0,0) model might be appropriate.

```{r usconsumptionar, fig.cap="Quarterly percentage change in US consumption expenditure.", cache=FALSE}
(fit2 <- Arima(usconsumption[,1], order=c(3,0,0)))
```

This model is actually slightly better than the model identified by `auto.arima` (with an AICc value of 342.35 compared to 344.44). The `auto.arima` function did not find this model because it does not consider all possible models in its search. You can make it work harder by using the arguments `stepwise=FALSE` and `approximation=FALSE`:

```{r usconsumptiontryharder, fig.cap="Quarterly percentage change in US consumption expenditure.", cache=FALSE}
(fit3 <- auto.arima(usconsumption[,1], seasonal=FALSE,
  stepwise=FALSE, approximation=FALSE))
```

This time, `auto.arima` has found the same model that we guessed from the ACF and PACF plots. The forecasts from this ARIMA(3,0,0) model are almost identical to those shown in Figure \@ref(fig:usconsumptionf) for the ARIMA(2,0,2) model, so we do not produce the plot here.


## Estimation and order selection

### Maximum likelihood estimation  {-}

Once the model order has been identified (i.e., the values of $p$, $d$ and $q$), we need to estimate the parameters $c$, $\phi_1,\dots,\phi_p$, $\theta_1,\dots,\theta_q$. When R estimates the ARIMA model, it uses *maximum likelihood estimation* (MLE). This technique finds the values of the parameters which maximize the probability of obtaining the data that we have observed. For ARIMA models, MLE is very similar to the *least squares* estimates that would be obtained by minimizing
$$
  \sum_{t=1}^Te_t^2.
$$
(For the regression models considered in Chapter \@ref(ch-regression), MLE gives exactly the same parameter estimates as least squares estimation.) Note that ARIMA models are much more complicated to estimate than regression models, and different software will give slightly different answers as they use different methods of estimation, or different estimation algorithms.

In practice, R will report the value of the *log likelihood* of the data; that is, the logarithm of the probability of the observed data coming from the estimated model. For given values of $p$, $d$ and $q$, R will try to maximize the log likelihood when finding parameter estimates.

### Information Criteria  {-}

Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC), which was useful in selecting predictors for regression, is also useful for determining the order of an ARIMA model. It can be written as
$$
  \text{AIC} = -2 \log(L) + 2(p+q+k+1),
$$
where $L$ is the likelihood of the data, $k=1$ if $c\ne0$ and $k=0$ if $c=0$. Note that the last term in parentheses is the number of parameters in the model (including $\sigma^2$, the variance of the residuals).

For ARIMA models, the corrected AIC can be written as
$$
  \text{AICc} = \text{AIC} + \frac{2(p+q+k+1)(p+q+k+2)}{T-p-q-k-2}.
$$
and the Bayesian Information Criterion can be written as
$$
  \text{BIC} = \text{AIC} + [\log(T)-2](p+q+k+1).
$$
Good models are obtained by minimizing either the AIC, AICc or BIC. Our preference is to use the AICc.

##ARIMA modelling in R

### How does `auto.arima()` work? {-}

The `auto.arima()` function in R uses a variation of the Hyndman and Khandakar algorithm which combines unit root tests, minimization of the AICc and MLE to obtain an ARIMA model. The algorithm follows these steps.

**Hyndman-Khandakar algorithm for automatic ARIMA modelling**

1.  The number of differences $d$ is determined using repeated KPSS tests.

2.  The values of $p$ and $q$ are then chosen by minimizing the AICc after differencing the data $d$ times. Rather than considering every possible combination of $p$ and $q$, the algorithm uses a stepwise search to traverse the model space.

    (a) The best initial model (with smallest ) is selected from the following four:

        * ARIMA$(2,d,2)$,
        * ARIMA$(0,d,0)$,
        * ARIMA$(1,d,0)$,
        * ARIMA$(0,d,1)$.

        If $d=0$ then the constant $c$ is included; if $d\ge1$ then the constant $c$ is set to zero. This is called the "current model".

    (b) Variations on the current model are considered:

        -   vary $p$ and/or $q$ from the current model by $\pm1$;
        -   include/exclude $c$ from the current model.

        The best model considered so far (either the current model, or one of these variations) becomes the new current model.

    (c) Repeat Step 2(b) until no lower AICc can be found.

The arguments to `auto.arima()` provide for many variations on the algorithm. What is described here is the default behaviour.

### Choosing your own model  {-}

If you want to choose the model yourself, use the `Arima()` function in R. For example, to fit the ARIMA(0,0,3) model to the US consumption data, the following commands can be used.

```{r usconsumption2, cache=FALSE}
fit <- Arima(usconsumption[,1], order=c(0,0,3))
```

There is another function `arima()` in R which also fits an ARIMA model. However, it does not allow for the constant $c$ unless $d=0$, and it does not return everything required for the `forecast()` function. Finally, it does not allow the estimated model to be applied to new data (which is useful for checking forecast accuracy). Consequently, it is recommended that you use `Arima()` instead.

### Modelling procedure  {-}

When fitting an ARIMA model to a set of time series data, the following procedure provides a useful general approach.

1.  Plot the data. Identify any unusual observations.

2.  If necessary, transform the data (using a Box-Cox transformation) to stabilize the variance.

3.  If the data are non-stationary: take first differences of the data until the data are stationary.

4.  Examine the ACF/PACF: Is an AR($p$) or MA($q$) model appropriate?

5.  Try your chosen model(s), and use the AICc to search for a better model.

6.  Check the residuals from your chosen model by plotting the ACF of the residuals, and doing a portmanteau test of the residuals. If they do not look like white noise, try a modified model.

7.  Once the residuals look like white noise, calculate forecasts.

The automated algorithm only takes care of steps 3--5. So even if you use it, you will still need to take care of the other steps yourself.

The process is summarized in Figure \@ref(fig:arimaflowchart).


```{r arimaflowchart, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE, fig.cap="General process for forecasting using an ARIMA model."}
knitr::include_graphics("arimaflowchart.png")
```


###Example: Seasonally adjusted electrical equipment orders {-}

We will apply this procedure to the seasonally adjusted electrical equipment orders data shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ee1).

```{r ee1, fig.cap="Seasonally adjusted electrical equipment orders index in the Euro area.", cache=FALSE}
eeadj <- seasadj(stl(elecequip, s.window="periodic"))
autoplot(eeadj)
```

```{r ee2, fig.cap="Time plot and ACF and PACF plots for differenced seasonally adjusted electrical equipment data.", cache=FALSE}
ggtsdisplay(diff(eeadj), main="")
```

1.  The time plot shows some sudden changes, particularly the big drop in 2008/2009. These changes are due to the global economic environment. Otherwise there is nothing unusual about the time plot and there appears to be no need to do any data adjustments.

2.  There is no evidence of changing variance, so we will not do a Box-Cox transformation.

3.  The data are clearly non-stationary as the series wanders up and down for long periods. Consequently, we will take a first difference of the data. The differenced data are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ee2). These look stationary, and so we will not consider further differences.

4.  The PACF shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ee2) is suggestive of an AR(3) model. So an initial candidate model is an ARIMA(3,1,0). There are no other obvious candidate models.

5.  We fit an ARIMA(3,1,0) model along with variations including ARIMA(4,1,0), ARIMA(2,1,0), ARIMA(3,1,1), etc. Of these, the ARIMA(3,1,1) has a slightly smaller AICc value.

```{r eeadj1, cache=FALSE}
fit <- Arima(eeadj, order=c(3,1,1))
summary(fit)
```

6.  The ACF plot of the residuals from the ARIMA(3,1,1) model shows all correlations within the threshold limits indicating that the residuals are behaving like white noise. A portmanteau test returns a large p-value, also suggesting the residuals are white noise.

```{r eeadj2, cache=FALSE}
checkresiduals(fit)
```

7.  Forecasts from the chosen model are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:ee4).

```{r ee4, fig.cap="Forecasts for the seasonally adjusted electrical orders index.", cache=FALSE}
autoplot(forecast(fit))
```

If we had used the automated algorithm instead, we would have obtained an ARIMA(3,1,0) model using the default settings, but the ARIMA(3,1,1) model if we had set `approximation=FALSE`.

```{r testmodel, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
if(!identical(arimaorder(auto.arima(eeadj)), c(3L,1L,0L)))
  stop("Claim 1 untrue")
if(!identical(arimaorder(auto.arima(eeadj, approximation=FALSE)), c(3L,1L,1L)))
  stop("Claim 2 untrue")
```

### Understanding constants in R {-}

A non-seasonal ARIMA model can be written as
\begin{equation}
(\#eq:c)
  (1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(1-B)^d y_t = c + (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t
\end{equation}
or equivalently as
\begin{equation}
(\#eq:mu)
  (1-\phi_1B - \cdots - \phi_p B^p)(1-B)^d (y_t - \mu t^d/d!) = (1 + \theta_1 B + \cdots + \theta_q B^q)e_t,
\end{equation}
where $c = \mu(1-\phi_1 - \cdots - \phi_p )$ and $\mu$ is the mean of $(1-B)^d y_t$. R uses the parametrization of equation \@ref(eq:mu).

Thus, the inclusion of a constant in a non-stationary ARIMA model is equivalent to inducing a polynomial trend of order $d$ in the forecast function. (If the constant is omitted, the forecast function includes a polynomial trend of order $d-1$.) When $d=0$, we have the special case that $\mu$ is the mean of $y_t$.

By default, the `Arima()` function sets $c=\mu=0$ when $d>0$ and provides an estimate of $\mu$ when $d=0$. It will be close to the sample mean of the time series, but usually not identical to it as the sample mean is not the maximum likelihood estimate when $p+q>0$.

The argument `include.mean` only has an effect when $d=0$ and is `TRUE` by default. Setting `include.mean=FALSE` will force $\mu=c=0$.

The argument `include.drift` allows $\mu\ne0$ when $d=1$. For $d>1$, no constant is allowed as a quadratic or higher order trend is particularly dangerous when forecasting. The parameter $\mu$ is called the "drift" in the R output when $d=1$.

There is also an argument `include.constant` which, if `TRUE`, will set `include.mean=TRUE` if $d=0$ and `include.drift=TRUE` when $d=1$. If `include.constant=FALSE`, both `include.mean` and `include.drift` will be set to `FALSE`. If `include.constant` is used, the values of `include.mean=TRUE` and `include.drift=TRUE` are ignored.

The `auto.arima()` function automates the inclusion of a constant. By default, for $d=0$ or $d=1$, a constant will be included if it improves the AICc value; for $d>1$ the constant is always omitted. If `allowdrift=FALSE` is specified, then the constant is only allowed when $d=0$.

##Forecasting

### Point forecasts {-}

Although we have calculated forecasts from the ARIMA models in our examples, we have not yet explained how they are obtained. Point forecasts can be calculated using the following three steps.

1.  Expand the ARIMA equation so that $y_t$ is on the left hand side and all other terms are on the right.

2.  Rewrite the equation by replacing $t$ by $T+h$.

3.  On the right hand side of the equation, replace future observations by their forecasts, future errors by zero, and past errors by the corresponding residuals.

Beginning with $h=1$, these steps are then repeated for $h=2,3,\dots$ until all forecasts have been calculated.

The procedure is most easily understood via an example. We will illustrate it using the ARIMA(3,1,1) model fitted in the previous section. The model can be written as follows
$$
  (1-\hat{\phi}_1B -\hat{\phi}_2B^2-\hat{\phi}_3B^3)(1-B) y_t = (1+\hat{\theta}_1B)e_{t},
$$
where $\hat{\phi}_1=0.0519$, $\hat{\phi}_2=0.1191$, $\hat{\phi}_3=0.3730$ and $\hat{\theta}_1=-0.4542$. Then we expand the left hand side to obtain
$$
  \left[1-(1+\hat{\phi}_1)B +(\hat{\phi}_1-\hat{\phi}_2)B^2 + (\hat{\phi}_2-\hat{\phi}_3)B^3 +\hat{\phi}_3B^4\right] y_t = (1+\hat{\theta}_1B)e_{t},
$$
and applying the backshift operator gives
$$
  y_t - (1+\hat{\phi}_1)y_{t-1} +(\hat{\phi}_1-\hat{\phi}_2)y_{t-2} + (\hat{\phi}_2-\hat{\phi}_3)y_{t-3} +\hat{\phi}_3y_{t-4} = e_t+\hat{\theta}_1e_{t-1}.
$$
Finally, we move all terms other than $y_t$ to the right hand side:
$$\label{arima301f}
  y_t = (1+\hat{\phi}_1)y_{t-1} -(\hat{\phi}_1-\hat{\phi}_2)y_{t-2} - (\hat{\phi}_2-\hat{\phi}_3)y_{t-3} -\hat{\phi}_3y_{t-4} + e_t+\hat{\theta}_1e_{t-1}.
$$
This completes the first step. While the equation now looks like an ARIMA(4,0,1), it is still the same ARIMA(3,1,1) model we started with. It cannot be considered an ARIMA(4,0,1) because the coefficients do not satisfy the stationarity conditions.

For the second step, we replace $t$ by $T+1$ in :
$$
  y_{T+1} = (1+\hat{\phi}_1)y_{T} -(\hat{\phi}_1-\hat{\phi}_2)y_{T-1} - (\hat{\phi}_2-\hat{\phi}_3)y_{T-2} -\hat{\phi}_3y_{T-3} + e_{T+1}+\hat{\theta}_1e_{T}.
$$
Assuming we have observations up to time $T$, all values on the right hand side are known except for $e_{T+1}$ which we replace by zero and $e_T$ which we replace by the last observed residual $\hat{e}_T$:
$$
  \hat{y}_{T+1|T} = (1+\hat{\phi}_1)y_{T} -(\hat{\phi}_1-\hat{\phi}_2)y_{T-1} - (\hat{\phi}_2-\hat{\phi}_3)y_{T-2} -\hat{\phi}_3y_{T-3} + \hat{\theta}_1\hat{e}_{T}.
$$

A forecast of $y_{T+2}$ is obtained by replacing $t$ by $T+2$ in . All values on the right hand side will be known at time $T$ except $y_{T+1}$ which we replace by $\hat{y}_{T+1|T}$, and $e_{T+2}$ and $e_{T+1}$, both of which we replace by zero:
$$
  \hat{y}_{T+2|T} = (1+\hat{\phi}_1)\hat{y}_{T+1|T} -(\hat{\phi}_1-\hat{\phi}_2)y_{T} - (\hat{\phi}_2-\hat{\phi}_3)y_{T-1} -\hat{\phi}_3y_{T-2}.
$$

The process continues in this manner for all future time periods. In this way, any number of point forecasts can be obtained.

### Forecast intervals  {-}

The calculation of ARIMA forecast intervals is much more difficult, and the details are largely beyond the scope of this book. We will just give some simple examples.

The first forecast interval is easily calculated. If $\hat{\sigma}$ is the standard deviation of the residuals, then a 95% forecast interval is given by $\hat{y}_{T+1|T} \pm 1.96\hat{\sigma}$. This result is true for all ARIMA models regardless of their parameters and orders.

Multi-step forecast intervals for ARIMA(0,0,$q$) models are relatively
easy to calculate. We can write the model as
$$
  y_t = e_t + \sum_{i=1}^q \theta_i e_{t-i}.
$$
Then the estimated forecast variance can be written as
$$
  v_{T+h|T} = \hat{\sigma}^2 \left[ 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{h-1} \hat{\theta}_i^2\right], \qquad\text{for $h=2,3,\dots$,}
$$
and a 95% forecast interval is given by $\hat{y}_{T+h|T} \pm 1.96\sqrt{v_{T+h|T}}$.

In Section \@ref(sec:mamodels), we showed that an AR(1) model can be written as an MA($\infty$) model. Using this equivalence, the above result for MA($q$) models can also be used to obtain forecast intervals for AR(1) models.

More general results, and other special cases of multi-step forecast intervals for an ARIMA($p$,$d$,$q$) model, are given in more advanced textbooks such as Brockwell and Davis (1991, Section 9.5).

The forecast intervals for ARIMA models are based on assumptions that the residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed. If either of these are assumptions do not hold, then the forecast intervals may be incorrect. For this reason, always plot the ACF and histogram of the residuals to check the assumptions before producing forecast intervals.

In general, forecast intervals from ARIMA models will increase as the forecast horizon increases. For stationary models (i.e., with $d=0$), they will converge so forecast intervals for long horizons are all essentially the same. For $d>1$, the forecast intervals will continue to grow into the future.

As with most forecast interval calculations, ARIMA-based intervals tend to be too narrow. This occurs because only the variation in the errors has been accounted for. There is also variation in the parameter estimates, and in the model order, that has not been included in the calculation. In addition, the calculation assumes that the historical patterns that have been modelled will continue into the forecast period.

##Seasonal ARIMA models {#sec-seasonal-arima}

So far, we have restricted our attention to non-seasonal data and non-seasonal ARIMA models. However, ARIMA models are also capable of modelling a wide range of seasonal data.

A seasonal ARIMA model is formed by including additional seasonal terms in the ARIMA models we have seen so far. It is written as follows:

| ARIMA | $~\underbrace{(p, d, q)}$ | $\underbrace{(P, D, Q)_{m}}$ |
| ----: | :-----------------------: | :--------------------------: |
|       | ${\uparrow}$              | ${\uparrow}$                 |
|       | Non-seasonal part         | Seasonal part of             |
|       | of the model              | of the model                 |

where $m =$ number of observations per year. We use uppercase notation for the seasonal parts of the model, and lowercase notation for the non-seasonal parts of the model.

The seasonal part of the model consists of terms that are very similar to the non-seasonal components of the model, but they involve backshifts of the seasonal period. For example, an ARIMA$(1,1,1)(1,1,1)$_{4}$ model (without a constant) is for quarterly data ($m=4$) and can be written as
$$
  (1 - \phi_{1}B)~(1 - \Phi_{1}B^{4}) (1 - B) (1 - B^{4})y_{t} =
  (1 + \theta_{1}B)~ (1 + \Theta_{1}B^{4})e_{t}.
$$

The additional seasonal terms are simply multiplied with the non-seasonal terms.

### ACF/PACF {-}

The seasonal part of an AR or MA model will be seen in the seasonal lags of the PACF and ACF. For example, an ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,0,1)$_{12}$ model will show:

-   a spike at lag 12 in the ACF but no other significant spikes.
-   The PACF will show exponential decay in the seasonal lags; that is, at lags 12, 24, 36, ...

Similarly, an ARIMA(0,0,0)(1,0,0)$_{12}$ model will show:

-   exponential decay in the seasonal lags of the ACF
-   a single significant spike at lag 12 in the PACF.

In considering the appropriate seasonal orders for an ARIMA model, restrict attention to the seasonal lags.

The modelling procedure is almost the same as for non-seasonal data, except that we need to select seasonal AR and MA terms as well as the non-seasonal components of the model. The process is best illustrated via examples.

###Example: European quarterly retail trade {-}

We will describe the seasonal ARIMA modelling procedure using quarterly European retail trade data from 1996 to 2011. The data are plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:euretail1).

```{r euretail1, fig.cap="Quarterly retail trade index in the Euro area (17 countries), 1996--2011, covering wholesale and retail trade, and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles. (Index: 2005 = 100).", cache=FALSE}
autoplot(euretail) + ylab("Retail index") + xlab("Year")
```

The data are clearly non-stationary, with some seasonality, so we will first take a seasonal difference. The seasonally differenced data are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:euretail2). These also appear to be non-stationary, and so we take an additional first difference, shown in Figure \@ref(fig:euretail3).

```{r euretail2, fig.cap="Seasonally differenced European retail trade index.", cache=FALSE}
ggtsdisplay(diff(euretail,4))
```

```{r euretail3, fig.cap="Double differenced European retail trade index.", cache=FALSE}
ggtsdisplay(diff(diff(euretail,4)))
```

Our aim now is to find an appropriate ARIMA model based on the ACF and PACF shown in Figure \@ref(fig:euretail3). The significant spike at lag 1 in the ACF suggests a non-seasonal MA(1) component, and the significant spike at lag 4 in the ACF suggests a seasonal MA(1) component. Consequently, we begin with an ARIMA(0,1,1)(0,1,1)$_4$ model, indicating a first and seasonal difference, and non-seasonal and seasonal MA(1) components. The residuals for the fitted model are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:euretail4). (By analogous logic applied to the PACF, we could also have started with an ARIMA(1,1,0)(1,1,0)$_4$ model.)

```{r euretail4, fig.cap="Residuals from the fitted ARIMA(0,1,3)(0,1,1)$_4$ model for the European retail trade index data.", cache=FALSE}
fit <- Arima(euretail, order=c(0,1,1), seasonal=c(0,1,1))
ggtsdisplay(residuals(fit))
```

Both the ACF and PACF show significant spikes at lag 2, and almost significant spikes at lag 3, indicating some additional non-seasonal terms need to be included in the model. The AICc of the ARIMA(0,1,2)(0,1,1)$_4$ model is 74.36, while that for the ARIMA(0,1,3)(0,1,1)$_4$ model is 68.53. We tried other models with AR terms as well, but none that gave a smaller AICc value. Consequently, we choose the ARIMA(0,1,3)(0,1,1)$_4$ model. Its residuals are plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:euretail5). All the spikes are now within the significance limits, and so the residuals appear to be white noise. A Ljung-Box test also shows that the residuals have no remaining autocorrelations.

```{r euretail5, fig.cap="Residuals from the fitted ARIMA(0,1,3)(0,1,1)$_4$ model for the European retail trade index data.", cache=FALSE}
fit3 <- Arima(euretail, order=c(0,1,3), seasonal=c(0,1,1))
checkresiduals(fit3)
```

So we now have a seasonal ARIMA model that passes the required checks and is ready for forecasting. Forecasts from the model for the next three years are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:euretail6). Notice how the forecasts follow the recent trend in the data (this occurs because of the double differencing). The large and rapidly increasing prediction intervals show that the retail trade index could start increasing or decreasing at any time --- while the point forecasts trend downwards, the prediction intervals allow for the data to trend upwards during the forecast period.

```{r euretail6, fig.cap="Forecasts of the European retail trade index data using the ARIMA(0,1,3)(0,1,1)$_4$ model. 80% and 95% prediction intervals are shown.", cache=FALSE}
autoplot(forecast(fit3, h=12))
```

We could have used `auto.arima()` to do most of this work for us. It would have given the following result.

```{r euretail, cache=FALSE}
auto.arima(euretail)
```

Notice that it has selected a different model (with a larger AICc value). `auto.arima()` takes some short-cuts in order to speed up the computation and will not always give the best model. You can turn the short-cuts off and then it will sometimes return a different model.

```{r euretailauto, cache=TRUE}
auto.arima(euretail, stepwise=FALSE, approximation=FALSE)
```

This time it returned the same model we had identified.

###Example: Cortecosteroid drug sales in Australia {-}

Our second example is more difficult. We will try to forecast monthly cortecosteroid drug sales in Australia. These are known as H02 drugs under the Anatomical Therapeutical Chemical classification scheme.

```{r h02, fig.cap="Cortecosteroid drug sales in Australia (in millions of scripts per month). Logged data shown in bottom panel.", cache=FALSE}
lh02 <- log(h02)
tmp <- cbind("H02 sales (million scripts)" = h02,
             "Log H02 sales"=lh02)
autoplot(tmp, facets=TRUE) + xlab("Year") + ylab("")
```

Data from July 1991 to June 2008 are plotted in Figure \@ref(fig:h02). There is a small increase in the variance with the level, and so we take logarithms to stabilize the variance.

The data are strongly seasonal and obviously non-stationary, and so seasonal differencing will be used. The seasonally differenced data are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:h02b). It is not clear at this point whether we should do another difference or not. We decide not to, but the choice is not obvious.

The last few observations appear to be different (more variable) from the earlier data. This may be due to the fact that data are sometimes revised as earlier sales are reported late.

```{r h02b, fig.cap="Seasonally differenced cortecosteroid drug sales in Australia (in millions of scripts per month).", cache=FALSE}
ggtsdisplay(diff(lh02,12), xlab="Year",
  main="Seasonally differenced H02 scripts")
```

In the plots of the seasonally differenced data, there are spikes in the PACF at lags 12 and 24, but nothing at seasonal lags in the ACF. This may be suggestive of a seasonal AR(2) term. In the non-seasonal lags, there are three significant spikes in the PACF suggesting a possible AR(3) term. The pattern in the ACF is not indicative of any simple model.

Consequently, this initial analysis suggests that a possible model for these data is an ARIMA(3,0,0)(2,1,0)$_{12}$. We fit this model, along with some variations on it, and compute their AICc values which are shown in the following table.

| Model | AICc|
|:------: |:------:|
| ARIMA(3,0,0)(2,1,0)$_{12}$ | $-475.12$ |
| ARIMA(3,0,1)(2,1,0)$_{12}$ | $-476.31$ |
| ARIMA(3,0,2)(2,1,0)$_{12}$ | $-474.88$ |
| ARIMA(3,0,1)(1,1,0)$_{12}$ | $-463.40$ |
| ARIMA(3,0,1)(0,1,1)$_{12}$ | $-483.67$ |
| ARIMA(3,0,1)(0,1,2)$_{12}$ | $-485.48$ |
| ARIMA(3,0,1)(1,1,1)$_{12}$ | $-484.25$ |

Of these models, the best is the ARIMA(3,0,1)(0,1,2)$_{12}$ model (i.e., it has the smallest AICc value).

```{r h02arima}
(fit <- Arima(h02, order=c(3,0,1), seasonal=c(0,1,2), lambda=0))
```

The residuals from this model are shown in Figure \@ref(fig:h02res). There are significant spikes in both the ACF and PACF, and the model fails a Ljung-Box test. The model can still be used for forecasting, but the prediction intervals may not be accurate due to the correlated residuals.

```{r h02res, fig.cap="Residuals from the ARIMA(3,0,1)(0,1,2)$_{12}$ model applied to the H02 monthly script sales data.", cache=FALSE}
checkresiduals(fit)
```

Next we will try using the automatic ARIMA algorithm. Running `auto.arima()` with arguments left at their default values led to an ARIMA(2,1,3)(0,1,1)$_{12}$ model. However, the model still fails a Ljung-Box test. Sometimes it is just not possible to find a model that passes all the tests.

Finally, we tried running `auto.arima()` with differencing specified to be $d=0$ and $D=1$, and allowing larger models than usual. This led to an ARIMA(4,0,3)(0,1,1)$_{12}$ model, which did pass all the tests.

```{r h02arima2, cache=TRUE}
fit <- auto.arima(h02, lambda=0, d=0, D=1, max.order=9,
  stepwise=FALSE, approximation=FALSE)
checkresiduals(fit)
```

#### Test set evaluation: {-}

We will compare some of the models fitted so far using a test set consisting of the last two years of data. Thus, we fit the models using data from July 1991 to June 2006, and forecast the script sales for July 2006 -- June 2008. The results are summarised in the following table.

```{r h02search, cache=TRUE}
models <- rbind(
  c(3,0,0,2,1,0),
  c(3,0,1,2,1,0),
  c(3,0,2,2,1,0),
  c(3,0,1,1,1,0),
  c(3,0,1,0,1,1),
  c(3,0,1,0,1,2),
  c(3,0,1,1,1,1),
  c(4,0,3,0,1,1),
  c(3,0,3,0,1,1),
  c(4,0,2,0,1,1),
  c(3,0,2,0,1,1),
  c(2,1,3,0,1,1),
  c(2,1,4,0,1,1),
  c(2,1,5,0,1,1))
h <- 24
train.end <- time(h02)[length(h02)-h]
test.start <- time(h02)[length(h02)-h+1]
train <- window(h02,end=train.end)
test <- window(h02,start=test.start)

rmse <- numeric(NROW(models))
modelname <- character(NROW(models))
for(i in seq(length(rmse)))
{
  fit <- Arima(train, order=models[i,1:3],
          seasonal=models[i,4:6], lambda=0)
  fc <- forecast(fit,h=h)
  rmse[i] <- accuracy(fc, test)[2,"RMSE"]
  modelname[i] <- as.character(fit)
}
knitr::kable(data.frame(Model=modelname,RMSE=rmse),
             digits=4)
```

The models that have the lowest AICc values tend to give slightly better results than the other models, but there is not a large difference. Also, the only model that passed the residual tests did not give the best test set RMSE values.

When models are compared using AICc values, it is important that all models have the same orders of differencing. However, when comparing models using a test set, it does not matter how the forecasts were produced --- the comparisons are always valid. Consequently, in the table above, we can include some models with only seasonal differencing and some models with both first and seasonal differencing. But in the earlier table containing AICc values, we compared models with only seasonal differencing.

None of the models considered here pass all the residual tests. In practice, we would normally use the best model we could find, even if it did not pass all tests.

Forecasts from the ARIMA(3,0,1)(0,1,2)$_{12}$ model (which has the lowest RMSE value on the test set, and the best AICc value amongst models with only seasonal differencing and fewer than six parameters) are shown in the figure below.

```{r h02f, fig.cap="Forecasts from the ARIMA(3,0,1)(0,1,2)$_{12}$ model applied to the H02 monthly script sales data.", cache=FALSE}
fit <- Arima(h02, order=c(3,0,1), seasonal=c(0,1,2), lambda=0)
autoplot(forecast(fit)) +
  ylab("H02 sales (million scripts)") + xlab("Year")
```

##ARIMA vs ETS

It is a commonly held myth that ARIMA models are more general than exponential smoothing. While linear exponential smoothing models are all special cases of ARIMA models, the non-linear exponential smoothing models have no equivalent ARIMA counterparts. There are also many ARIMA models that have no exponential smoothing counterparts. In particular, every ETS model is non-stationary, while ARIMA models can be stationary.

The ETS models with seasonality or non-damped trend or both have two unit roots (i.e., they need two levels of differencing to make them stationary). All other ETS models have one unit root (they need one level of differencing to make them stationary).

The following table gives the equivalence relationships for the two classes of models.

|**ETS model**  | **ARIMA model**             | **Parameters**                       |
| :------------ | :-------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| ETS(A,N,N)    | ARIMA(0,1,1)                | $\theta_1 = \alpha-1$                |
| ETS(A,A,N)    | ARIMA(0,2,2)                | $\theta_1 = \alpha+\beta-2$          |
|               |                             | $\theta_2 = 1-\alpha$                |
| ETS(A,A,N)    | ARIMA(1,1,2)                | $\phi_1=\phi$                        |
|               |                             | $\theta_1 = \alpha+\phi\beta-1-\phi$ |
|               |                             | $\theta_2 = (1-\alpha)\phi$          |
| ETS(A,N,A)    | ARIMA(0,0,$m$)(0,1,0)$_m$   |                                      |
| ETS(A,A,A)    | ARIMA(0,1,$m+1$)(0,1,0)$_m$ |                                      |
| ETS(A,A,A)    | ARIMA(1,0,$m+1$)(0,1,0)$_m$ |                                      |


For the seasonal models, there are a large number of restrictions on the ARIMA parameters


##Exercises

1. Figure \@ref(wnacf) shows the ACFs for 36 random numbers, 360 random numbers and for 1,000 random numbers.

(a) Explain the differences among these figures. Do they all indicate the data are white noise?

```{r wnacfplus, fig.height=3, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
x1 <- rnorm(36)
x2 <- rnorm(360)
x3 <- rnorm(1000)
p1 <- ggAcf(x1, ylim=c(-1,1), main="", lag.max = 20)
p2 <- ggAcf(x2, ylim=c(-1,1), main="", lag.max = 20)
p3 <- ggAcf(x3, ylim=c(-1,1), main="", lag.max = 20)
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2,p3,nrow=1)
```

(b) Why are the critical values at different distances from the mean of zero? Why are the autocorrelations different in each figure when they each refer to white noise?

2. A classic example of a non-stationary series is the daily closing IBM stock prices (data set `ibmclose`). Use R to plot the daily closing prices for IBM stock and the ACF and PACF. Explain how each plot shows the series is non-stationary and should be differenced.

3. For the following series, find an appropriate Box-Cox transformation and order of differencing in order to obtain stationary data.

(e) `visitors`

4. For the `enplanements` data, write down the differences you chose above using backshift operator notation.

5. Use R to simulate and plot some data from simple ARIMA models.

(a) Use the following R code to generate data from an AR(1) model with $\phi_{1} = 0.6$ and $\sigma^2=1$. The process starts with $y_1=0$.

```
    y <- ts(numeric(100))
    e <- rnorm(100)
    for(i in 2:100)
       y[i] <- 0.6*y[i-1] + e[i]
```

(b) Produce a time plot for the series. How does the plot change as you change $\phi_1$?

(c) Write your own code to generate data from an MA(1) model with $\theta_{1}  =  0.6$ and $\sigma^2=1$.

(e) Generate data from an ARMA(1,1) model with $\phi_{1} = 0.6$ and $\theta_{1}  = 0.6$ and $\sigma^2=1$.

(f) Generate data from an AR(2) model with $\phi_{1} =-0.8$ and $\phi_{2} = 0.3$ and $\sigma^2=1$. (Note that these parameters will give a non-stationary series.)

(g) Graph the latter two series and compare them.

An alternative is to use a `msts` object which handles multiple seasonality time series. Then you can specify all the frequencies that might be relevant. It is also flexible enough to handle non-integer frequencies.

You won't necessarily want to include all of these frequencies --- just the ones that are likely to be present in the data. For example, if you have only 180 days of data, you can probably ignore the annual seasonality. If the data are measurements of a natural phenomenon (e.g., temperature), you might also be able to ignore the weekly seasonality.

With multiple seasonalities, you could use a TBATS model, or Fourier terms in a regression or ARIMA model. The `fourier` function from the forecast package will handle `msts` objects.
